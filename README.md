# Cat-vs-Dog-Classifier-using-Deep-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
This project focuses on building and training a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify images as either cats or dogs. The project utilizes the Keras library with a TensorFlow backend, working with a dataset containing 25,000 labeled images of cats and dogs.
